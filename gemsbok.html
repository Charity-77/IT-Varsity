                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                <p>Gemsbok are large antelopes of the genus <em>Oryx</em> in the family Bovidae and the order
                    Artiodactyla. The most
                    well-known species is the South African gemsbok (<em>Oryx gazella</em>), which is native to arid
                    regions such as the
                    Kalahari Desert. These striking animals are recognized for their long, straight horns and bold
                    markings. Other
                    related species in the genus include the Arabian oryx and the scimitar oryx, though these are found
                    in different
                    geographic areas.</p>

                <p>All gemsbok share several distinctive features, the most notable of which are their long, spear-like
                    horns that can
                    reach up to 1.2 meters (4 ft) in length and are present in both males and females. They have a tan
                    or grayish body
                    with contrasting black and white facial patterns and markings on the legs and flanks. Gemsbok are
                    well adapted to
                    dry environments and can survive without water for extended periods by drawing moisture from the
                    food they eat.
                    Their muscular bodies and strong limbs allow them to travel long distances in search of food and
                    water.</p>

                <p>Gemsbok are herbivorous and typically inhabit open plains, deserts, and savannahs. They feed on
                    grasses, roots, and
                    bulbs, and are often found in arid regions where few other large herbivores can thrive. Despite
                    their desert
                    habitat, they prefer areas where water is at least seasonally available.</p>
