                <h3>GORRILLA</h3>
                <p>Gorillas are large primates of the genus <em>Gorilla</em> and are part of the family Hominidae. Two
                    species are
                    traditionally recognised: the eastern gorilla (<em>Gorilla beringei</em>) and the western gorilla
                    (<em>Gorilla
                        gorilla</em>), with each species further divided into subspecies such as the mountain gorilla
                    and the western
                    lowland gorilla. Gorillas are found in the tropical and subtropical forests of central Africa. They
                    are the largest
                    living primates and share a significant percentage of their DNA with humans, making them one of our
                    closest
                    relatives.</p>

                <p>All gorillas have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is their large, muscular
                    build and broad
                    chests. They walk using their knuckles and have opposable thumbs and toes that aid in grasping.
                    Adult males develop
                    a patch of silver hair on their backs, earning them the name “silverbacks.” Gorillas have a gentle
                    nature,
                    communicate through vocalizations and gestures, and live in social groups led by a dominant
                    silverback. Their
                    expressive faces and complex emotions are similar to humans.</p>

                <p>Gorillas are herbivorous and primarily eat leaves, stems, fruit, and bamboo shoots. They inhabit
                    dense forests,
                    including lowland swamps and montane forests, and are usually found near areas with abundant
                    vegetation and water
                    sources.</p>
