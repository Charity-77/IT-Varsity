                <h3>LION</h3>
                <p>Lions are large carnivorous mammals of the family Felidae and the genus Panthera. One
                    species is traditionally recognised, the African lion (<em>Panthera leo</em>), although some
                    evidence suggests that populations in West Africa and Central Africa may represent distinct
                    subspecies. Lions are mainly found in sub-Saharan Africa, with a small population of Asiatic lions
                    (<em>Panthera leo persica</em>) surviving in the Gir Forest of India. Felidae is the only surviving
                    family of the order Carnivora to include lions; other large extinct relatives include cave lions
                    and American lions. Male African lions are among the largest living carnivores and can reach a
                    length of 3.3 m (11 ft) including the tail and weigh up to 250 kg (550 lb).</p>

                <p>All lions have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is the male's thick mane,
                    which varies in color and size and serves to protect the neck during fights. Lions possess powerful
                    jaws and sharp retractable claws used for hunting and defense. They have strong muscular bodies
                    built for short bursts of speed and strength. African lions typically have a tawny coat, while
                    Asiatic lions tend to be slightly smaller with a less developed mane and a longitudinal fold of skin
                    along the belly.</p>

                <p>Lions are carnivorous and can be found in various habitats including grasslands, savannahs,
                    woodlands, and scrublands. They prefer areas with access to water and abundant prey. Lions are
                    social animals and live in groups called prides.</p>
