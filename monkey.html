                <h3>Monkey</h3>
                <p>Monkeys are intelligent mammals of the primate order and are part of the infraorder Simiiformes.
                    Two major groups are traditionally recognised: New World monkeys (Platyrrhines) and Old World
                    monkeys
                    (Cercopithecoidea), each with a wide variety of species. New World monkeys are found in Central and
                    South America,
                    while Old World monkeys are native to Africa and Asia. Monkeys are closely related to apes and
                    humans,
                    all of which share a common ancestor. Species include the capuchin, macaque, baboon, and howler
                    monkey,
                    each adapted to their environments. Some species, such as the mandrill, are among the largest
                    monkeys
                    and can weigh over 50 kg (110 lb).</p>

                <p>All monkeys have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is their dexterous hands
                    and feet, often with opposable thumbs, allowing them to grasp and manipulate objects. Many species
                    have long tails, which in some, like spider monkeys, are prehensile and used for climbing and
                    balance.
                    Their forward-facing eyes provide good depth perception, useful for navigating forest canopies.
                    New World monkeys tend to have flatter noses and are generally smaller, while Old World monkeys
                    have more pronounced snouts and may have cheek pouches or sitting pads.</p>

                <p>Monkeys are omnivorous and live in a wide range of habitats including tropical rainforests,
                    mountains, savannahs, and even urban areas. They are highly social animals and often live in troops.
                    Most species are arboreal, spending much of their time in trees, although some, like baboons, are
                    primarily terrestrial.</p>
