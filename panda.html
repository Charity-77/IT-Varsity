                <h3>PANDA</h3>
                <p>Pandas are medium-sized mammals of the family Ursidae and the order Carnivora. One
                    species is traditionally recognised, the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca),
                    although the red panda (Ailurus fulgens), once considered related, belongs to a
                    separate family. Pandas are native to the mountain ranges of central China,
                    primarily in Sichuan, but also in Shaanxi and Gansu. The giant panda is the most
                    well-known member of its genus and is distinct for its black-and-white coloring.
                    It is one of the most iconic and endangered animals in the world. Adult pandas
                    can reach a length of 1.5 m (5 ft) and weigh up to 160 kg (350 lb).</p>
                <p>All pandas have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is their
                    large head with round face and black patches around their eyes, ears, and body.
                    Their strong jaws and large molar teeth are specially adapted for crushing
                    bamboo, which is their primary diet. Pandas have a unique adaptation known as a
                    "pseudo-thumb"—an extended wrist bone—that helps them grasp bamboo stalks. Unlike
                    other bears, pandas do not hibernate and are generally solitary animals. They
                    communicate through vocalizations and scent markings. Their thick fur keeps them
                    warm in the cool, mountainous regions they inhabit.</p>
                <p>Pandas are herbivorous, with over 99% of their diet consisting of bamboo, though
                    they occasionally eat other vegetation or small animals. They are found in dense
                    bamboo forests at elevations between 1,200 and 3,100 meters. Pandas rely heavily
                    on forested areas with abundant bamboo and access to fresh water.</p>
