                <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                <p>Giraffes are tall mammals belonging to the family Giraffidae and the order Artiodactyla. One extant
                    species is
                    recognised, the giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis), although several subspecies exist, including the
                    Masai giraffe,
                    Reticulated giraffe, and Southern giraffe. Some recent genetic studies suggest that these may
                    represent separate
                    species. Giraffes are native to various regions of sub-Saharan Africa, typically found in savannahs,
                    grasslands, and
                    open woodlands. Giraffidae also includes the okapi, the giraffe's only living relative. Giraffes are
                    the tallest
                    terrestrial animals, with adult males reaching heights up to 5.5 m (18 ft) and weighing around 1,200
                    kg (2,600 lb).
                </p>

                <p>All giraffes have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is their long neck, which
                    allows them to
                    reach foliage high in trees that other herbivores cannot access. They also have long legs and a
                    unique coat pattern
                    consisting of patches separated by lighter lines, which provides camouflage in their environment.
                    Giraffes have
                    ossiconesâ€”skin-covered horn-like structures on their heads. Their large eyes give them excellent
                    vision, and their
                    long prehensile tongues, measuring up to 45 cm (18 in), assist in grasping leaves and twigs. Despite
                    their height,
                    giraffes have only seven neck vertebrae, the same number as most mammals.</p>

                <p>Giraffes are herbivorous and primarily feed on the leaves, flowers, and fruits of trees and shrubs,
                    particularly
                    acacia species. They are typically found in areas with abundant browse and need to drink regularly,
                    so they often
                    stay near water sources.</p>
