                <h3>KOALA</h3>
                <p>Koalas are small to medium-sized marsupials of the family Phascolarctidae and the order
                    Diprotodontia. A single
                    extant species is recognised, the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), which is native to Australia.
                    Although they are
                    sometimes called "koala bears", they are not bears but marsupials. Koalas are found in coastal
                    regions of eastern
                    and southern Australia, from Queensland to South Australia. Phascolarctidae is a family that once
                    included several
                    extinct relatives of the koala, but today only the koala survives. Adult male koalas can reach a
                    length of 85 cm (33
                    in) and weigh up to 14 kg (31 lb).</p>

                <p>All koalas have several distinctive features, the most notable of which is their large, leathery
                    nose, used for
                    detecting scent and recognizing other koalas. They have strong limbs and sharp claws adapted for
                    climbing trees.
                    Koalas have a thick, soft coat of fur and large, fluffy ears that enhance their sense of hearing.
                    Their opposable
                    digits and rough pads help them grip tree branches. Koalas possess a highly specialized digestive
                    system, including
                    a long cecum, allowing them to digest toxic eucalyptus leaves, which make up the bulk of their diet.
                </p>

                <p>Koalas are herbivorous and are almost exclusively found in eucalyptus forests and woodlands. They
                    spend most of their
                    time in trees and are typically sedentary, sleeping up to 18â€“22 hours a day. They rely on eucalyptus
                    trees not only
                    for food but also for hydration and shelter.</p>
