                <h3>RHINO-BEETLE</h3>
                <p>Rhino beetles are large insects belonging to the subfamily Dynastinae, within the family Scarabaeidae
                    and the order
                    Coleoptera. Many species of rhino beetles are recognized, including the European rhinoceros beetle
                    (<i>Oryctes
                        nasicornis</i>) and the Japanese rhinoceros beetle (<i>Allomyrina dichotoma</i>). Some
                    scientists classify other
                    related beetles, such as the Hercules beetle and the elephant beetle, under the broader rhinoceros
                    beetle group due
                    to shared characteristics. Rhino beetles are distributed across tropical and subtropical regions
                    including parts of
                    Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. Dynastinae is a diverse and still extant subfamily of
                    scarab beetles; other
                    related but distinct groups include dung beetles, flower chafers, and June beetles. Male rhino
                    beetles are among the
                    strongest insects and can lift objects up to 850 times their body weight.</p>

                <p>All rhino beetles possess several distinctive features, the most prominent being a large horn-like
                    structure on the
                    malesâ€™ head or thorax, used mainly for combat and mating displays. These horns vary in shape and
                    size depending on
                    the species. Rhino beetles have a hard exoskeleton that offers protection, and they use their strong
                    forelegs to dig
                    and climb. Their elytra (hardened forewings) protect the delicate flight wings underneath. Males
                    typically have more
                    developed horns than females, and while they appear fearsome, rhino beetles are harmless to humans.
                </p>

                <p>Rhino beetles are herbivorous and commonly found in habitats such as forests, gardens, and
                    agricultural areas. They
                    are especially attracted to decaying wood, fruit, and sap, and many species thrive in warm, humid
                    environments.</p>
