                <h3>TIGER</h3>
                <p>Tigers are large carnivorous mammals of the family Felidae and the genus Panthera. One
                    species is traditionally recognized, the tiger (Panthera tigris), with several subspecies
                    including the Bengal tiger, Siberian tiger, Sumatran tiger, and Malayan tiger. Tigers are
                    primarily found across parts of South and Southeast Asia, as well as the Russian Far East.
                    They are the largest members of the cat family and are known for their power and striking
                    orange coat with black stripes. Adult male tigers can reach a length of 3.3 m (11 ft)
                    including the tail, and weigh up to 300 kg (660 lb).</p>

                <p>All tigers share several distinctive features, most notably their striped fur which provides
                    camouflage in their natural habitat. They have strong jaws and sharp teeth adapted for hunting
                    large prey such as deer and wild boar. Tigers are solitary animals and mark their territories
                    with scent markings. Their muscular bodies and retractable claws make them powerful hunters.
                    Bengal tigers are known for their vibrant coloration, while Siberian tigers tend to have
                    paler coats and thicker fur suited for cold climates.</p>

                <p>Tigers are obligate carnivores and live in a variety of habitats, including tropical forests,
                    grasslands, mangrove swamps, and savannas. They typically reside near sources of water,
                    which they need not only for drinking but also for cooling off by swimming.</p>
