                <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                <p>Warthogs are wild members of the pig family <em>Suidae</em> and the order <em>Artiodactyla</em>. Two
                    species are commonly recognised: the common warthog (<em>Phacochoerus africanus</em>) and the desert
                    warthog
                    (<em>Phacochoerus aethiopicus</em>), although the latter is less widespread and more specialized for
                    arid
                    environments.
                    Warthogs are distributed across much of sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in savannahs, grasslands,
                    and lightly
                    wooded areas.
                    Suidae includes other wild pigs such as bushpigs and red river hogs, but warthogs are among the most
                    adapted for
                    open terrain.
                    Male common warthogs can reach a shoulder height of up to 85 cm (33 in) and weigh as much as 150 kg
                    (330 lb).</p>

                <p>All warthogs have several distinctive features, the most notable of which are their large, curved
                    tusks,
                    used for defense and digging. They also possess facial warts, which are actually thickened skin pads
                    that offer
                    protection during fights. Their bodies are covered with sparse bristly hair, and they often have a
                    mane running
                    along their spine. Warthogs are known for their habit of entering burrows backward, allowing them to
                    defend
                    themselves from predators with their tusks facing outward.</p>

                <p>Warthogs are herbivorous, primarily feeding on grasses, roots, berries, and bark. They are
                    well-adapted to
                    dry habitats and can survive long periods without water, although they prefer to remain within range
                    of water
                    sources when possible.</p>

                <strong>
                    <p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p>
                </strong>
                <p>You will find the warthog at pen E23, right next to the elephant.</p>
